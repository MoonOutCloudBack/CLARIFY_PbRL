    "### 1. **Metaworld Dial-Turn Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Purpose**:  \n",
    "In this task, you will be comparing two segments of a robotic arm trying to turn a dial. Your goal is to evaluate which segment performs better in achieving the task's objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:  \n",
    "- **Step 1**: First, choose the segment where the robot's arm reaches the dial more accurately (the **reach** component).  \n",
    "- **Step 2**: If the reach performance is the same in both segments, then choose the one where the robot's gripper is closed more appropriately (the **gripper closed** component).  \n",
    "- **Step 3**: If both reach and gripper closure are equal, choose the segment that has the robot's arm placed closer to the target position (the **in place** component).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Metaworld Hammer Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Purpose**:  \n",
    "In this task, you will be comparing two segments where a robotic arm is hammering a nail. The aim is to evaluate which segment results in a better execution of the hammering process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:  \n",
    "- **Step 1**: First, choose the segment where the hammerhead is in better position and the nail is properly hit (the **reward in place** component).  \n",
    "- **Step 2**: If the hammerhead positioning is similar in both segments, choose the one where the robot is better holding the hammer and the nail (the **reward grab** component).  \n",
    "- **Step 3**: If both the hammerhead position and grasping are the same, select the segment where the orientation of the hammer is more suitable (the **reward quaternion** component).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **DMControl Walker-Walk Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Purpose**:  \n",
    "In this task, you will compare two segments where a bipedal robot is attempting to walk. Your goal is to determine which segment shows better walking performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:  \n",
    "- **Step 1**: First, choose the segment where the robot stands more stably (the **standing** reward).  \n",
    "- **Step 2**: If both segments have the same stability, choose the one where the robot moves faster or more smoothly (the **move reward**).  \n",
    "- **Step 3**: If both standing and moving are comparable, select the segment where the robot maintains better upright posture (the **upright** reward).  \n",
